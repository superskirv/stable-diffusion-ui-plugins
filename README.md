UI Plugins for the Stable Diffusion UI

Install into your `C:\stable-diffusion-ui\plugins\ui` folder.

DateFolderNames.plugin.js will not work with multiple tabs simultaneously. This plugin is designed for single user, single tab. I use it to help keep my images in easily structured folders. It could be modified to include hour:minute:second:millisecond if needed.
